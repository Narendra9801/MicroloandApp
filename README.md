# Microloan dApp

## Project Title
Microloan dApp

## Project Description
The Microloan dApp is a decentralized platform that enables users to issue and receive small loans in Lumens (XLM). Borrowers can request loans, and lenders can issue loans directly on the platform. The terms of the loans, including interest rates and repayment schedules, are managed through Soroban smart contracts.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Microloan dApp is to create an accessible, decentralized financial ecosystem that empowers users to access microloans without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. By leveraging the Stellar blockchain and Lumens, this dApp ensures fast, low-cost transactions, providing a fair and transparent lending environment.

## Key Features
- **Loan Issuance**: Lenders can issue small loans to borrowers, with smart contracts managing the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms.
- **Loan Repayment**: Borrowers can repay their loans through the platform, with the smart contract automatically calculating the interest and total repayment amount.
- **Transparency and Security**: All loan transactions are recorded on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Decentralized**: The platform operates without intermediaries, giving users complete control over their loan agreements and transactions.
